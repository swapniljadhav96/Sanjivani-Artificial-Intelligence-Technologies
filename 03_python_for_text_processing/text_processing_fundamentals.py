goto-Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
(unaudited)
Now we want to extract title
 'Summary of Significant Accounting Policies'
 goto regex101.com
'''
#let us assume we have simple text as below,we want to extract phone number
'''
goto regex101.com,on right bootom there are various patterns 
and their meaning,suppose I want to extract any digit,there is pattern
\d
copy the text1 in text string window
and write \d\d\d\d\d\d\d\d\d\d in regular expression window
observe the match information window
The 10 digit number is matched
But writing \d\d\d\d\d\d\d\d\d\d is cumbersome
In right bottom window there is pattern for multiple digits
exactly 3 of a :a{3}
here a is \d :
goto regular expression window
type-\d{10}
and you will get 9991116666
------------------------
But what about (999)-333-7777
Now let us try to match this,first we will try Elon,go to
 regular expression window,write Elon
 you will find Elon match in text
 Now we want ()
Assume '(' is a special charecter
\( ,now open ( is matching
-We have exactly three digits
\d{3},go to regular expression window and type \(\d{3}
Now we got (999
If we try \(\d{3}\) now we are getting (999)
If we will try \(\d{3}\)-\d{3}-\d{4} and we are getting (999)-333-7777
If we will try \d{10} or \(\d{3}\)-\d{3}-\d{4}
-There is pattern for OR expression,right bottom window
a|b
The pattern will be  \(\d{3}\)-\d{3}-\d{4}|\d{10}
Goto regular expression window and type  \(\d{3}\)-\d{3}-\d{4}| \d{10}
and we are getting
9991116666
(999)-333-7777

Matches either what is before the | or what is after it - in this case `a` or `b`.
