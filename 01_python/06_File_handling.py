# the output will still be available after
# you close the terminal containing your program’s output.

# to the text you write. So if
# you write more than one line without
# including newline characters

# Appending to a File
# If you want to add content to a file
# instead of writing over existing content,
# you can open the file in append mode.
# When you open a file in append mode,
# Python doesn’t erase the contents of the file
# before returning the file object.

    # rather than writing over the existing file.

# another way is that to pass the file name as the input in the open braceses as follows
